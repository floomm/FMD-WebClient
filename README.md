Feel free to contribute and open pull requests.

As a first step, follow the [Getting Started guide](https://firmwaredroid.github.io/posts/getting-started/) to install FirmwareDroid.

If you have successfully set up FirmwareDroid, please stop and remove its containers.

```shell
docker compose down
```

Next, please open directory `/FirmwareDroid` and uncomment the following line in file `docker-compose.yml`.

```shell
cd FirmwareDroid
```

```dockerfile
- ./firmware-droid-client/build:/usr/share/nginx/html # Dev-Route
```

Optionally, fork repository <https://github.com/FirmwareDroid/FMD-WebClient>, delete directory `/firmware-droid-client` and clone your forked repository. Note that the web frontend directory needs to be called `firmware-droid-client`.

```shell
rm -rf firmware-droid-client

git clone https://github.com/<username-with-fork>/FMD-WebClient firmware-droid-client
```

Then, open directory `/firmware-droid-client` and install the web frontend's dependencies and build it.

```shell
cd firmware-droid-client

yarn install && yarn build
```

And then switch back to directory `/FirmwareDroid` and create and start the containers again.

```shell
cd ..

docker compose up
```

At this point, verify that the web frontend is running at <https://fmd.localhost>.

If it is running, you are set to make changes to the frontend's source code in `/firmware-droid-client`. To apply your changes build the project again.

```shell
yarn build
```

Finally, if you refresh the page you should see your changes.
